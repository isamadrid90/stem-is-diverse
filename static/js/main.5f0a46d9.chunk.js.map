In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The highest distinction in computer science and the 'Nobel Prize of computing' is named after him (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award). \n        He was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Creator of the Turing machine.\n        worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. At the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.\n        Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment, 'gross indecency' was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.\" \n        dates=\"23/09/1912\"\n        link=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing\"\n        ></Person>\n\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default People;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport People from './components/People';\nimport {\n  Route,\n  NavLink,\n  HashRouter\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <HashRouter>\n        <div className=\"App\">\n          <ul className=\"header\">\n            <li><NavLink exact to=\"/\">Home</NavLink></li>\n            <li><NavLink to=\"/people\">People</NavLink></li>\n          </ul>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home}/>\n            <Route path=\"/people\" component={People}/> \n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </HashRouter>\n      );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
